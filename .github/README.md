# Basic Tkinter Calculator

This is a very basic tkinter based calculator - a small program built as per instructions. There's literally noting special about this project, but can hopefully be a good start for others new to tkinter.

Python (and Tkinter ofcourse) is required to run this project. You can run the following command from the project directory in your terminal / command prompt:

```sh
python main.py
```

This will build the native program and display a small calculator with a fixed size (not resizable).
